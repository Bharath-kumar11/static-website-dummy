    <h1>DOSA ðŸ¥Ÿ</h1>
    <p>A dosa is a thin, savoury crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground white gram and rice. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar 
        (a lentil-based vegetable stew). Dosas are popular in South Asia as well as around the world.</p>

            <h1>Origin of Dosa</h1>
            <p>In popular tradition outside of Southern India, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants.The Tamil dosa is traditionally softer and thicker;
                 the thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka.A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, 
                who ruled from present-day Karnataka.</p>
